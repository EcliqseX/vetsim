# Vet Clinic Simulator

A simple browser-based vet simulator/game. You are a veterinarian diagnosing and treating pets that come into your clinic.

How to run:
1. Place the files (index.html, style.css, script.js) in a folder.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome/Firefox/Edge).
3. Play!

Gameplay overview:
- Customers (with pets) arrive in the Waiting Room.
- Click "Next Customer" to call the next pet in.
- You'll see observed symptoms (these may include some noise).
- Run tests (cost money and have imperfect accuracy) to gather evidence.
- Choose a diagnosis from the dropdown and submit it.
- If you diagnose correctly, you'll get treatment options that earn money and reputation.
- Incorrect diagnoses may cost reputation and money.
- Keep an eye on money and reputation.

If you want additional features, tell me which you'd like:
- More diseases/pets
- A persistent save system
- Levels/difficulty or timed mode
- Visuals/animations or sound
- Multiplayer/leaderboards

Enjoy!
